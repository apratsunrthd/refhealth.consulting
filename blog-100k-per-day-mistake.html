          A recent feature on Reconfigured highlights why technical skills alone aren&rsquo;t enough in regulated data environments &mdash; and how deep domain knowledge prevents costly mistakes.

              I was recently featured in an article on <a href="https://reconfigured.io/blog/100k-per-day-mistake-domain-knowledge-brad-lumley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconfigured</a> called <em>&ldquo;The $100,000 Per Day Mistake: Why Domain Knowledge Trumps Technical Skills.&rdquo;</em><br />
              It dives into something I&rsquo;ve seen play out again and again in healthcare analytics: <strong>technical skill gets you started, but domain understanding keeps you out of trouble.</strong>
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h4>The Stakes Are Real</h4>
            <p>
              In regulated industries like healthcare, mistakes aren&rsquo;t just bugs &mdash; they&rsquo;re fines, compliance issues, and broken trust.<br />
              In the Reconfigured interview, I shared how a single misstep in data handling could cost up to <strong>$100,000 per day</strong> in state penalties.<br />
              That reality forces teams to think beyond just &ldquo;getting the data right.&rdquo; They need to understand <em>why</em> the data matters &mdash; how it ties to policy, operations, and regulation.
            </p>

            <h4>The Role of Translation</h4>
            <p>
              One of the biggest themes from the article is the importance of translators &mdash; people who can bridge business and technology.<br />
              I&rsquo;ve spent much of my career in that space, helping analytics and IT teams build with business context in mind.<br />
              You can&rsquo;t build systems for healthcare compliance, reporting, or operations without understanding how the business actually runs.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&rsquo;s the real differentiator: the ability to <strong>speak both languages</strong> &mdash; the SQL <em>and</em> the strategy.
            </p>

            <h4>Domain Knowledge Is a Competitive Advantage</h4>
            <p>
              The Reconfigured piece makes a clear point:<br />
              as tools and automation continue to improve, <strong>domain knowledge becomes the real moat.</strong><br />
              Anyone can spin up a dashboard or model a dataset.<br />
              Far fewer people understand how claims flow through Medicaid, what triggers regulatory scrutiny at the state level, or how member behavior actually impacts reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
              That context turns analytics from a technical service into a strategic capability.
            </p>

            <h4>How We Apply This at ref(health)</h4>
            <p>
              At ref(health), we build analytics systems with that same mindset.<br />
              Our projects combine <strong>data engineering best practices</strong> with deep understanding of healthcare delivery, payer operations, and regulatory frameworks.<br />
              It&rsquo;s not about building faster pipelines &mdash; it&rsquo;s about building systems that hold up under scrutiny and deliver insights people can trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&rsquo;s why we take domain knowledge as seriously as technical skill.
            </p>
